# Pathfinder-Visualizer
A small p5 application I made for my Artificial Intelligence class

To use you must select one of the four Search Algorithms:
- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A*

Also you need to have a start and end in the grid. 
You can paint the grid using the selector in the left. There are four types of cells:
- Start
- End
- Wall
- Mud

If you missplace a cell you can erase it using **Right-Click**.

If you are choosing the A* algorithm, there are three heuristic calculation:
- Manhattan
- Diagonal
- Euclidian

To start the search, press the start button and a animation will start. If you want to see step by step, check the **Step by Step** option and press the **Next Step** button. Uncheck the **Step by Step** box and press **Next Step** to go back to normal animation.
